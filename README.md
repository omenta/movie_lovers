This function takes input (name and age) of movie goers at a local movie theater and returns a list of ticket prices for each person.
If someone is under age 65, the ticket price is $10. For 65 years and older, the ticket price is $8. If the movie goers are a party of 5 or more, they get a 20% discount.
